# magento
Magento test
- Tasks 1 - 5 completed successfully in about 2hrs. Had some struggle enabling xDebug to previously installed MAMP, but otherwise everything went smoothly. Steps 6 - 10 are described below
- Add a new attribute in magento admin panel
    - Code: delivery_time
    - Used in product listing: Yes
- Assign created attribute to sample product data's "Accessories" attribute set displayed in "General Folder" for admin panel
- Added values for this attribute to a few products (eyeglasses; skus: ace000, ace001 and ace002)
- Modified directly list.phtmp within rwd templates to show values (if set).
